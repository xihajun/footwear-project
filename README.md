# Footwear project
*Project for Leverhulme Research Centre*

-	Introduced autoencoder and bag of word model for footwear object detection, segmentation, and localisation.
-	Obtained reasonable performance of handling random out-of-sample testing by only looking at 6 in-sample images.


All of the code can be found in the [code](./code/) folder. Files are individually documented, while the [README.md](code/README.md) file guides you through the narrative and ordering of the project. The cropped images used in this project can be found in [new](./new/). Original images can be found in [images](./images/).
